	<p>You might be wondering who the authour behind this website actually is! Well, my name is Hannah Phillips and when I'm not at University in Oxford,
		I live in Somerset (as shown in my banner image) with my mum, dad, brother and cat Loki. This is Loki:</span>

  <p>I am a second year student at Oxford Brookes University studying Media, Journalism and Publishing. Like any other student I cannot say no to the pub
	or a night out and desperately missing it during these Covid-19 times! This is a photo of me and some of my closest friends:

	<p>I also have a boyfriend named Callum who I've been with for over a year. He comes up to see me in Oxford every two weeks and we fill our weekends with
		going out for meals, playing crazy golf and watching films.

	<p>I love going on holidays and seeing different parts of the world, something I'm really missing right now!
		Some of my favourite places that I've been to are Switzerland, the Netherlands and Crotia but I'm keen to explore outside of Europe as I've never been!
